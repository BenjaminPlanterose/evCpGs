## Requirements

    Operating system: tested on Ubuntu 16.04LTS
    R: tested on R version 3.4.4 (2018-03-15) -- "Someone to Lean On"
    RAM requirements: Especially for data preprocessing, do not attempt to run without at least 50 GB of RAM.


## Structure

In the folder /Scripts/ you may find all the scripts employed in the data analysis of our Genome Biology paper. These are separated into the 7 sections of the paper:

  * 1) Data preparation: all scripts employed in the preprocessing of 450K data whose raw IDAT data were available: E-risk (GSE105018), Danish Twin Cohort (GSE61496), TwinsUK, NSPHS (GSE87571), Chinese Children (GSE104812), ENID-Gambia (GSE99863) and Longitudinal adipose tissue (GSE103768).
  
  * 2) evCpG discovery: all scripts employed in the identification of evCpGs in the E-risk cohort.
  
  * 3) evCpG annotation: all scripts employed in the functional annotation of evCpGs.
  
  * 4) evCpG technical and longitudinal variation assessment: all scripts employed in the assessment of technical and longitudinal stability of evCpGs.
  
  * 5) evCpGs' relationship with aging: all scripts employed in the assessment of the effects of aging on evCpGs.
  
  * 6) evCpGs' variation across tissues: all scripts employed in the exploration of evCpGs' behaviour in post-mortem tissues, the replication of evCpGs and there longitudinal stability in adipose tissue.
  
  * 7) evCpGs validation across technologies: all scripts employed in the validation of evCpGs in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data of monozygotic twins in blood and in adipose tissue
